# Liquidus Local plugin
By enabling and configuring this plugin with 
an Analytics account, such as Keen, Segment or Google, Admins will
be able to track different usage information from their sites.

Some of the usage information you can track is:

* User information – Encrypted, can track where the user is connecting from, with which type of device, roles, etc.
* Specific events – Such as login, course entered, activity entered, etc.
* Plugin usage – Which active plugins on your platform are being used.

Currently, the Liquidus plugin allows any admin to configure it for getting usage info.

This plugin was contributed by the Open LMS Product Development team. Open LMS is an education technology company
dedicated to bringing excellent online teaching to institutions across the globe.  We serve colleges and universities,
schools and organizations by supporting the software that educators use to manage and deliver instructional content to
learners in virtual classrooms.
